### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXsD0ZgxjRw) - This helped me to Learn how to use `APIs`. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Resource 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYb_ZU8LNxs) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand (`Async/Await, Promises, Callbacks`). I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
